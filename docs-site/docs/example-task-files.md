# Example Task Files

The `examples/` directory contains a large library of task definitions that demonstrate Banana Bun's features.

## Categories

- **basic-tasks** – simple scripts showing file operations and shell commands
- **media-processing** – ingestion, transcription, tagging and organization workflows
- **automation** – scheduled backups, downloads and maintenance
- **ai-powered** – cross-modal intelligence, planning and recommendations
- **batch-operations** – parallel or sequential multi-task workflows

Use these examples as templates for your own tasks. Each file includes metadata, tags and usage notes.
